    "After splitting the data into chunks, we need to prepare it for storage in ChromaDB so that it can be easily retrieved later. To do this, we need to vectorize the data. Vectorization involves converting the textual data into numerical vectors, which can then be stored and processed efficiently. This process typically involves using techniques such as word embeddings or document embeddings to represent the text data in a high-dimensional space. Once the data is vectorized, it can be stored in ChromaDB, allowing for fast and efficient retrieval when needed. This vectorization step is crucial for ensuring that the data is stored in a format that is suitable for use with ChromaDB and other similar databases."

Reduced Corruption and Misappropriation:**\\n\\n* Transparency makes it easier to monitor the use of poverty alleviation funds.\\n* It deterrents corruption and ensures that resources reach their intended beneficiaries.\\n* This reduces the amount of money lost to fraud, mismanagement, or diversion.\\n\\n**3. Enhanced Participation and Empowerment:**\\n\\n* Transparent reporting and accountability mechanisms empower the poor to hold decision-makers accountable.\\n* They can participate in decision-making processes and ensure that their voices are heard.\\n* This leads to more inclusive and effective poverty reduction strategies.\\n\\n**4. Increased Donor Confidence:**\\n\\n* Improved transparency and accountability enhance the credibility of poverty reduction programs.\\n* Donors are more likely to support programs that can demonstrate effective use of funds.\\n* This increases the availability of resources for poverty reduction initiatives.\\n\\n**5. Empowering Civil Society Organizations:**\\n\\n* Transparency allows civil society organizations (CSOs) to monitor and evaluate poverty alleviation programs.\\n* CSOs can use this information to advocate for the poor and hold governments accountable.\\n* This creates a stronger civil society that supports poverty reduction efforts.\\n\\n**Effects on Relative and Extreme Poverty:**\\n\\n**Relative Poverty:**\\n\\n* Increased accountability and transparency help reduce relative poverty by improving efficiency and targeting.\\n* By directing resources to the poorest, it reduces the income gap between the poor and the non-poor.\\n\\n**Extreme Poverty:**\\n\\n* These principles are crucial for reducing extreme poverty as they ensure that resources reach the most vulnerable and marginalized individuals.\\n* By reducing corruption and mismanagement, it prevents the loss of funds that could otherwise be used to lift people out of extreme poverty.\\n\\n**Other Benefits:**\\n\\n* Improved transparency and accountability foster trust between governments and citizens.\\n* They promote good governance and strengthen democratic institutions.\\n* These factors contribute to a more stable and equitable society, which is essential for long-term poverty reduction.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\n\\nIncreased accountability and transparency are powerful tools for reducing poverty, including both relative and extreme poverty. By improving efficiency, reducing corruption, enhancing participation, and increasing donor confidence, these principles create an environment where resources can be effectively utilized to lift people out of poverty.'"

      "\n",
      "SDG 16.6 and 16.7 aim to promote accountability and transparency, while SDG 1.1 and 1.2 target reducing poverty, both relative and extreme. Studies show that good governance enhances inclusive education, while inequality dampens its positive effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "The research examines thresholds of inequality that weaken the positive impact of governance on inclusive education in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Results indicate that governance unconditionally promotes inclusive education, but inequality mitigates this effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "The study also finds that:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Income inequality thresholds above which governance can no longer promote inclusive education range from 0.562 to 0.700.\n",
      "* The control of corruption and the rule of law are most effective in promoting inclusive education but are hindered by high levels of inequality.\n",
      "* The findings support the need to reduce income inequality and promote inclusive education to achieve SDG targets related to poverty reduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, increased accountability and transparency in governance contribute to reducing poverty by promoting inclusive education. To maximize the positive effects of governance, it is essential to address income inequality and ensure that it does not exceed established thresholds.\n",
