Enhanced accountability and transparency in governance positively contribute to reducing both absolute and relative poverty. This is achieved through several mechanisms:

  - Improved resource allocation: Increased transparency helps ensure that public resources are allocated more efficiently and effectively, reducing waste and corruption. This ensures that more resources are available for poverty reduction programs and initiatives.

  - Strengthened service delivery: Greater accountability promotes improved service delivery by government agencies, leading to better health, education, and other essential services for the poor and marginalized.

  - Increased civic participation: Transparency and accountability foster greater civic participation and empowerment, enabling citizens to hold their leaders accountable and advocate for policies that address poverty.

  - Reduced corruption: Enhanced transparency and accountability help reduce corruption, which disproportionately affects the poor. By curbing corrupt practices, governments can free up resources and create a more level playing field for economic growth and poverty reduction.

  Targets related to accountability and transparency in Sustainable Development Goal 16 (SDG 16.6 and 16.7) and poverty reduction in Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1.1 and 1.2) highlight the importance of these measures in achieving poverty reduction goals.
